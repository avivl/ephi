Ephi - The Ephemeral Bot for Slack

## What is Ephi?
Ephi is a very simple bot for Slack that allows users to send ephemeral messages that are automatically deleted for everyone (i.e. self destruct messages) after a set period of time. Yes, it's like Snapchat for Slack, but without the nudes (hopefully). 

Efi was build using Google App Engine
